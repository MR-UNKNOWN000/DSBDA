Here’s a complete **step-by-step explanation** for **Practical 5** of your **DSBDA practical exam**, based on the Logistic Regression code you shared:

---

## ✅ **Title**:

**Logistic Regression on Social Network Ads Dataset**

---

## ✅ **Purpose**:

To build a **binary classification model** using **Logistic Regression** that predicts whether a user will purchase a product based on their **Age** and **Estimated Salary**.

---

## ✅ **Execution Steps (in simple terms)**:

1. **Import Libraries**: Required for data handling, visualization, and ML modeling.
2. **Load Data**: Reads `Social_Network_Ads.csv` containing features like Age, Salary, and Purchase status.
3. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**:

   * Check structure, summary statistics, and missing values.
4. **Feature Selection**:

   * Inputs (`x`): Age and Estimated Salary.
   * Target (`y`): Purchased (0 or 1).
5. **Data Splitting**: Split into training and testing data (75% train, 25% test).
6. **Feature Scaling**: Standardize features for better model performance.
7. **Train Logistic Regression**: Fit the model on training data.
8. **Make Predictions**: Predict test data outcomes.
9. **Evaluate Model**:

   * Confusion matrix
   * Classification report
   * Accuracy, Error Rate, Precision, Recall, F1-score
10. **Visualize Results**: Display confusion matrix using `ConfusionMatrixDisplay`.

---

## ✅ **Theory (What the code does)**:

* **Logistic Regression** is used for **binary classification**.
* It outputs probabilities and then classifies based on a threshold (typically 0.5).
* This model predicts whether a person buys a product or not based on features like **Age** and **Estimated Salary**.

---

## ✅ **Theory of Output**:

* **`Confusion Matrix`**: Shows correct and incorrect predictions (True Positive, False Negative, etc.).
* **Classification Report**: Gives precision, recall, F1-score per class.
* **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly predicted instances.
* **Error Rate**: Fraction of incorrect predictions.
* **Sensitivity (Recall)**: How many actual positives were correctly predicted.
* **Specificity**: How many actual negatives were correctly identified.
* **Precision**: Of predicted positives, how many were actually positive.

---

## ✅ **Conclusion**:

* The logistic regression model was successfully trained and tested.
* It can now predict customer purchase behavior based on age and salary.
* Performance metrics and visualizations confirm how well the model performs.

## ✅ **10 Viva Questions & Answers**:

1. **Q: What type of algorithm is logistic regression?**
   **A:** It is a **supervised classification** algorithm.

2. **Q: Why do we use StandardScaler?**
   **A:** To **normalize** the features so that they have zero mean and unit variance.

3. **Q: What is the use of the confusion matrix?**
   **A:** To evaluate the performance of the classification model.

4. **Q: What is the formula for logistic regression?**
   **A:** `P = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))`, where z = linear combination of input features.

5. **Q: What are TP, FP, TN, FN?**
   **A:** True/False Positives and Negatives – they define prediction outcomes.

6. **Q: What does a high recall mean?**
   **A:** The model correctly predicted most of the actual positives.

7. **Q: Why use `.reshape(-1)` after confusion matrix?**
   **A:** To extract TP, FN, FP, TN as individual values from a 2x2 matrix.

8. **Q: What does accuracy\_score() return?**
   **A:** The percentage of correct predictions.

9. **Q: What does precision\_score() measure?**
   **A:** It measures the accuracy of positive predictions.

10. **Q: What is logistic regression mainly used for?**
    **A:** For **binary classification problems**, like spam detection or yes/no decisions.

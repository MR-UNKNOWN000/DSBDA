Great â€” hereâ€™s a complete guide for your DSBDA Practical 3 based on your provided code:

---

### âœ… **Title**:

**Statistical Analysis and Visualization using Pandas and Seaborn (Loan & Iris Dataset)**

---

### âœ… **Purpose of the Code**:

To perform descriptive statistics and data analysis on the loan and iris datasets using `pandas`, `numpy`, and `seaborn`, including measures like mean, median, standard deviation, mode, and data visualization techniques.

---

### âœ… **How to Execute the Code**:

1. Ensure the datasets `loan_data.csv` and `iris.csv` are in your working directory.
2. Run the Python script in a Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.
3. Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`.

---

### âœ… **Theory Behind the Code**:

#### ðŸ”¹ Part 1: Loan Dataset

* **Read data using pandas**: `read_csv()` to load `loan_data.csv`.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis**:

  * `.head()`, `.tail()`, `.info()`, `.describe()` to inspect structure.
  * `.isnull().sum()` to check missing values.
* **Statistical Measures**:

  * `mean()`, `median()`, `min()`, `std()` give central tendency and dispersion.
  * Grouping by `Age` helps understand how many entries exist for each age.

#### ðŸ”¹ Part 2: Iris Dataset

* **Reading Iris data** similarly.
* **Group by `Species`** to count entries and calculate means.
* **Statistical Measures**: `.mode()`, `.std()`, `.skew()`.
* **Visualization**:

  * `seaborn.violinplot()` is used to show distribution of `SepalWidthCm` per species.
* **Correlation Matrix**:

  * `.corr()` computes Pearson correlation between numeric features.

---

### âœ… **Conclusion**:

The practical demonstrates how to:

* Load and explore real-world datasets.
* Perform basic and advanced statistical analysis.
* Visualize feature distributions and relationships.
* Understand class-wise statistics using grouping.

---

### âœ… **Output Theory**:

* **`mean`, `median`, `std`**: Shows distribution of numerical fields like `Age`, `LoanAmount`.
* **`groupby('Species').mean()`**: Highlights differences in petal/sepal measurements among iris species.
* **`violinplot()`**: Graphically shows the spread and distribution of `SepalWidthCm` per species.
* **`correlation_matrix`**: Identifies which features have strong/weak linear relationships.
* **`.skew()`**: Indicates how symmetrical or skewed the data distribution is.

### âœ… **10 Viva Questions & Answers**:

1. **Q: What is the purpose of `data.info()`?**
   **A:** It shows the structure, non-null counts, and data types of the dataset.

2. **Q: How do you calculate the mean of a column in pandas?**
   **A:** Using `.mean()` on a column or dataframe.

3. **Q: What is the use of `.groupby()`?**
   **A:** It groups data based on column values to perform aggregate operations like count, mean, etc.

4. **Q: What does `.skew()` tell us?**
   **A:** It tells whether data is symmetrically distributed or skewed.

5. **Q: What is a violin plot used for?**
   **A:** It shows the distribution, median, and range of numerical data across categories.

6. **Q: What kind of correlation does `.corr()` show?**
   **A:** It shows Pearson correlation by default (linear relationships).

7. **Q: What is standard deviation?**
   **A:** It measures the spread or variability of a data set.

8. **Q: What is mode in statistics?**
   **A:** The value that appears most frequently in a dataset.

9. **Q: What does `.describe()` give you?**
   **A:** Summary statistics like mean, min, max, std, quartiles for numerical columns.

10. **Q: How do you handle missing values in pandas?**
    **A:** Using `.dropna()` to remove or `.fillna()` to impute them.

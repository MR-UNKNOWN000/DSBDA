Here‚Äôs a complete practical explanation and oral prep guide for **DSBDA Practical 8** based on your code:

---

## ‚úÖ **Title**:

**Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn (Titanic Dataset)**

---

## ‚úÖ **Purpose of the Code**:

To analyze and visualize the Titanic dataset using various plots to understand passenger survival patterns based on fare, age, class, and gender.

---

## ‚úÖ **How to Execute the Code**:

1. Ensure `titanic.csv` is in your working directory.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook or any IDE.
3. Run each code cell step-by-step.
4. Required Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.

---

## ‚úÖ **Theory Behind the Code**:

### üîπ **Data Loading and Inspection**

* `pd.read_csv()` is used to load the Titanic dataset.
* `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.shape` give information about structure, summary stats, and dataset dimensions.

### üîπ **Visualization using Seaborn**

1. **`sns.histplot(Fare)`**:

   * Shows distribution of passenger fares.
   * Helps detect skewed pricing and fare patterns.

2. **`sns.displot(Age)`**:

   * Histogram showing distribution of passenger ages with 70 bins.
   * Useful to identify age demographics.

3. **`sns.catplot(Survived vs Pclass)`**:

   * Categorical plot showing number of survivors grouped by passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
   * Helps analyze survival rate per class.

4. **`sns.catplot(Survived vs Sex)`**:

   * Compares survival count between males and females.
   * Useful for gender-based survival insight.

---

## ‚úÖ **Conclusion**:

* Data visualization reveals that:

  * Younger and 1st-class passengers had better survival rates.
  * Female passengers survived at a significantly higher rate than males.
  * Fare values are right-skewed, with a few very high fares.
* Seaborn provides powerful visual insight into categorical and continuous variables.

---

## ‚úÖ **Output Interpretation**:

* **Fare Histogram**: Shows most fares are clustered below \$100, indicating few passengers paid premium.
* **Age Distribution**: Highlights that most passengers were between 20‚Äì40 years old.
* **Survived vs Pclass Plot**: 1st class had higher survival, indicating social status impacted survival chances.
* **Survived vs Sex Plot**: Women had a higher survival rate due to ‚Äúwomen and children first‚Äù policy.

## ‚úÖ **10 Viva Questions & Answers**:

1. **Q: What is the purpose of this practical?**
   **A:** To visualize data using seaborn and matplotlib and find patterns in the Titanic dataset.

2. **Q: What does `sns.histplot()` do?**
   **A:** It creates a histogram to visualize the distribution of a numerical variable.

3. **Q: What is a `catplot` used for?**
   **A:** It‚Äôs used for visualizing categorical variables (e.g., count of survivors by class or gender).

4. **Q: What does the Titanic dataset contain?**
   **A:** Passenger information like age, sex, class, fare, and survival status from the Titanic shipwreck.

5. **Q: How do you change the figure size?**
   **A:** By using `sns.set(rc={'figure.figsize':(width,height)})`.

6. **Q: What does the hue parameter do in seaborn?**
   **A:** It adds color separation by another category (e.g., hue='Sex' separates male and female).

7. **Q: What insight does the Fare plot give?**
   **A:** It shows most passengers paid lower fares; few paid very high.

8. **Q: What type of plot is best for comparing survival across classes?**
   **A:** `catplot` is best to visualize count differences across classes.

9. **Q: What is `%matplotlib inline` used for?**
   **A:** It ensures that plots are displayed inline in a Jupyter Notebook.

10. **Q: Why do we use `.info()` before plotting?**
    **A:** To understand the data types and check for missing values or incorrect formats.

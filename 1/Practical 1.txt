‚úÖ Title: Titanic Dataset Cleaning and Preprocessing
üß† 1. Theory Behind the Code:
This project demonstrates data cleaning and preprocessing, which is a crucial step in the data analysis pipeline. The dataset used is the Titanic dataset, commonly used for machine learning problems.

Key steps include:

Reading the dataset

Checking for missing data

Imputing missing values based on logic

Dropping irrelevant or mostly null columns

Normalizing values (optional preparation step)

Preparing the cleaned data for further analysis or modeling

‚öôÔ∏è 2. How to Execute the Code (Steps):
Install required libraries: pandas, numpy, and optionally sklearn

Place the train.csv file in the same directory as your script

Run the script in a Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE like Spyder or VS Code

The cleaned dataset will be displayed after execution

üéØ 3. Purpose of the Code:
To clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset by:

Filling missing values logically

Removing non-essential or heavily null fields like "Cabin"

Dropping rows with any remaining missing values

To get the data ready for further analysis like model training

üìä 4. Explanation of the Output:
The dataset becomes free of missing values after cleaning

All rows now have consistent, usable data

"Age" is filled based on "Pclass" if it was missing, simulating a domain-specific imputation

The "Cabin" column, which contains many missing values, is completely removed

The resulting dataframe can be used for training ML models like logistic regression, decision trees, etc.

üìå 5. Conclusion:
We handled missing data effectively by either imputing or removing.

Data is now clean and ready for machine learning or visualization.

Preprocessing steps like these improve the performance and reliability of models.

‚ùì 6. Possible Viva Questions (With Answers):
Q1. What is the purpose of this project?
A1. To clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset for further analysis or machine learning.

Q2. Why did you choose to fill "Age" based on "Pclass"?
A2. Because passengers in different classes tend to have different average ages, which helps make the imputation more realistic.

Q3. What does the dropna() function do?
A3. It removes all rows that still contain any missing values.

Q4. Why did you drop the "Cabin" column?
A4. Because it has too many missing values and wouldn't contribute much to analysis.

Q5. What is data preprocessing?
A5. It's the process of cleaning and transforming raw data into a usable format for analysis or modeling.

Q6. What are null values and how do they affect models?
A6. Null values are missing entries in the dataset, and if not handled, they can cause errors or bias in the model.

Q7. What is the shape of the dataset and what does it tell you?
A7. The shape tells you how many rows and columns are present in the dataset.

Q8. What is the role of describe() in data analysis?
A8. It gives statistical summaries like mean, median, min, max, and standard deviation.

Q9. Why is cleaning data important in big data analytics?
A9. Clean data ensures accurate, reliable results from analysis or machine learning.

Q10. What other preprocessing steps can you apply?
A10. Encoding categorical variables, normalization, outlier removal, and feature scaling.

Here is a **complete and organized explanation for Practical 9** of your **DSBDA** lab, based on your code:

---

## âœ… **Title**:

**Data Visualization Using Seaborn â€“ Titanic Dataset**

---

## âœ… **Purpose**:

To visually analyze survival statistics from the Titanic dataset using **box plots** and **count plots**. The objective is to explore how gender and age relate to survival probability.

---

## âœ… **How to Execute**:

1. Open Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.
2. Ensure `seaborn` is installed (`pip install seaborn`).
3. The Titanic dataset is automatically loaded via `sns.load_dataset()`.
4. Run each line step by step to generate visualizations.

---

## âœ… **Theory Behind Each Step**:

### ðŸ”¹ Load Titanic Dataset

* `sns.load_dataset('titanic')` fetches Titanic passenger data including attributes like `sex`, `age`, and `survived`.

### ðŸ”¹ `sns.boxplot(x='sex', y='age', data=df, hue='survived')`

* This boxplot shows the **age distribution of male and female passengers**, split by **survival status**.
* Helps identify survival trends across age groups and genders.

### ðŸ”¹ `sns.catplot(x='survived',data=df, kind='count',hue='sex')`

* A count plot showing **number of survivors vs. non-survivors**.
* The `hue='sex'` adds a gender dimension to the survival statistics.

---

## âœ… **Conclusion**:

* Boxplots reveal that **younger passengers and females** were more likely to survive.
* Count plots show that **more females survived** compared to males.
* Visualization gives **quick insights into trends** that may not be obvious from raw data.

---

## âœ… **Theory of Output**:

1. **Box Plot**:

   * Shows **central age tendency** (median) and **distribution**.
   * Clear difference in **age survival patterns** between males and females.
2. **Count Plot**:

   * Displays actual **counts** of survivors vs. non-survivors.
   * Helps compare **male vs. female survival rate**.

## âœ… **10 Viva Questions & Answers**:

1. **Q: What is the purpose of this practical?**
   **A:** To visualize and compare Titanic survival rates using Seaborn plots.

2. **Q: What does the box plot show?**
   **A:** Age distribution per gender, divided by survival status.

3. **Q: Why use hue in boxplot and catplot?**
   **A:** To differentiate categories (e.g., survived vs. not) within another category (e.g., sex).

4. **Q: What does the count plot reveal?**
   **A:** The number of people who survived or didnâ€™t, split by gender.

5. **Q: What does the median line in a box plot represent?**
   **A:** The middle value of the dataset (50th percentile).

6. **Q: What are outliers in a box plot?**
   **A:** Data points that fall far from the rest of the distribution.

7. **Q: What dataset is used in this practical?**
   **A:** The Titanic dataset, loaded via Seaborn.

8. **Q: How is Seaborn different from Matplotlib?**
   **A:** Seaborn is built on Matplotlib and provides more visually appealing, high-level API for statistical graphics.

9. **Q: What is the function of `sns.set(rc={'figure.figsize':(5,5)})`?**
   **A:** To set the size of the figure (width, height in inches).

10. **Q: Can we analyze numeric and categorical data together?**
    **A:** Yes, plots like boxplots and catplots allow combining numeric and categorical analysis.

Here’s a complete breakdown of your **DSBDA Practical 6** (Naive Bayes on the Iris dataset) to help you prepare for your viva:

---

### ✅ **Purpose of the Code**

To classify iris flowers into species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using the **Naive Bayes classification algorithm** and evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

---

### ✅ **Theory of the Code**

* **Dataset**: Iris dataset with features like SepalLength, SepalWidth, PetalLength, PetalWidth.
* **Label Encoding**: The target column (Species) is categorical and must be converted to numeric using `LabelEncoder`.
* **Train-Test Split**: Data is split into training (70%) and testing (30%) to evaluate model performance.
* **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Uses `GaussianNB()` which assumes features are normally distributed.
* **Predictions**: Model predicts species on the test set.
* **Evaluation**:

  * Confusion Matrix: To visualize prediction performance.
  * Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

---

### ✅ **How to Execute the Code**

1. Ensure `Iris.csv` is in your working directory.
2. Install required libraries if not already (`sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, `numpy`).
3. Run the Python script or Jupyter notebook cell by cell.
4. Observe the outputs (metrics, prediction, confusion matrix).

---

### ✅ **Theory About the Output**

* You’ll get a **confusion matrix** plot showing how well the model predicted each species.
* Classification report will provide **precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy** per class.
* The console will show detailed values like:

  * True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), etc.
  * Sensitivity (Recall)
  * Specificity
  * False Positive Rate
  * Error Rate

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**

* The Naive Bayes classifier works well for Iris dataset classification.
* Model evaluation metrics confirm its effectiveness.
* Confusion matrix visually confirms classification correctness.
* Feature independence assumption in Naive Bayes may not always be perfect but performs well on small datasets like Iris.

### ✅ **10 Viva Questions with Answers**

1. **Q: What algorithm did you use?**
   A: Gaussian Naive Bayes classification.

2. **Q: Why do we use Naive Bayes here?**
   A: It's simple, efficient, and performs well for multiclass classification with normally distributed features.

3. **Q: What is the Iris dataset?**
   A: A dataset containing 150 rows of iris flowers with features and species labels.

4. **Q: Why did you use LabelEncoder?**
   A: To convert string labels (species names) into numeric format for the classifier.

5. **Q: What does the confusion matrix represent?**
   A: It shows the count of correct and incorrect predictions per class.

6. **Q: What is precision and recall?**
   A: Precision is the ratio of true positives to predicted positives; Recall is the ratio of true positives to actual positives.

7. **Q: What is the meaning of sensitivity in this context?**
   A: It's the same as recall – the ability to identify true positives.

8. **Q: What does a higher F1-score mean?**
   A: It means a good balance between precision and recall.

9. **Q: What is the assumption in Gaussian Naive Bayes?**
   A: Features are normally distributed and conditionally independent given the class.

10. **Q: What does the accuracy score tell us?**
    A: The overall proportion of correct predictions made by the model.
